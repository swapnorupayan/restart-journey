            <h3>Web developer and Digital Marketer</h3>
            <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it's the work that happens behind the scenes
                to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. ... The field
                of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the
                server side).
                No one can thrive in the modern marketplace without having a digital footprint. Now more than ever,
                brands are becoming mobile, portable and shareable. Creating this dynamic online presence with smart and
                sticky digital content and impactful online experiences is essential. They are the critical components
                to having a successful brand.

                <h3>2020-2021 | Learning Period</h3>
                <p>Digital marketing is the component of marketing that utilizes internet and online based digital
                    technologies such as desktop computers, mobile phones and other digital media and platforms to
                    promote products and services.[2][3] Its development during the 1990s and 2000s, changed the way
                    brands and businesses use technology for marketing. As digital platforms became increasingly
                    incorporated into marketing plans and everyday life,[4] and as people increasingly use digital
                    devices instead of visiting physical shops,[5][6] digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent,
                    employing combinations of search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), content
                    marketing, influencer marketing, content automation, campaign marketing, data-driven marketing,
                    e-commerce marketing, social media marketing, social media optimization, e-mail direct marketing,
                    display advertising, e–books, and optical disks and games have become commonplace. Digital marketing
                    extends to non-Internet channels that provide digital media, such as television, mobile phones (SMS
                    and MMS), callback, and on-hold mobile ring tones.[7] The extension to non-Internet channels
                    differentiates digital marketing from online marketing.</p>
